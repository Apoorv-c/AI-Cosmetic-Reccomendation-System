# 💄 AI Cosmetic Recommendation System

A facial-recognition-powered cosmetic recommendation tool that uses **OpenCV** to detect facial features (e.g., skin tone, face region) and aims to integrate **machine learning** for smarter, more personalized product recommendations.

This project is ideal for those interested in **computer vision**, **ML integration**, and **beauty tech**.

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Facial analysis using OpenCV
- 🤖 (In Progress) ML-based recommendation system based on user data
- 💄 Cosmetic product suggestions tailored to skin tone/type
- 🌐 UI with **HTML/CSS/JS** and optional **Streamlit**
- 🧠 Dataset expansion with real-world beauty products

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / ML models** *(planned)*
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (UI)
- **Streamlit** (optional Python-based UI)

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. Users upload a facial image or use webcam input.
2. OpenCV analyzes the face to determine:

   * Skin tone
   * Region of interest (e.g., lips, cheeks)
3. *(Planned)* Machine learning model will:

   * Analyze user data (e.g., age, skin concerns)
   * Recommend products based on historical patterns and similarity
4. The system displays personalized cosmetic suggestions.
